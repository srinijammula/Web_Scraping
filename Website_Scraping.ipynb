            "Abstract: Customer care is important for its role in relationship building. This role has traditionally been performed by human customer agents; however, the emergence of interactive generative AI (GenAI) shows potential for using AI for customer care in emotionally charged interactions. Bridging practice and the academic literatures in marketing and computer science, this article develops an AI-enabled customer care journey, from accurate emotion recognition to empathetic response, emotional management support, and, finally, the establishment of an emotional connection. Marketing requirements for each of the stages are derived from in-depth interviews with top managers and a survey of chief marketing officers. By juxtaposing these requirements against the current feeling capabilities of GenAI, the authors highlight the technological challenges engineers must tackle. The article concludes with a set of marketing tenets for implementing and researching the caring machine. These include verifying emotion recognition accuracy using marketing emotion theories through multiple emotion signals and methods, utilizing prompt engineering to enhance GenAI’s emotion understanding, employing “response engineering” to personalize emotion management recommendations, and strategically deploying GenAI for emotional connection to simultaneously enhance customer emotional well-being and customer lifetime value.\n",

            "Abstract: Marketing scholars have extensively studied marketing's effect on firm value and have developed metrics and dashboards to help establish marketing accountability. However, empirical evidence of marketing accountability's specific outcomes is scarce and mainly derived from surveys. It also lacks consideration of outcomes beyond the marketing function's standing in the firm, thus overlooking possible downsides and outcomes with regard to external stakeholders such as investors. Using a natural experiment—Australia's change from a nonrestrictive to a restrictive accounting regime—this study investigates how accountability for the financial value of marketing assets (marketing asset accountability) affects a firm's marketing management focus on short-term vis-à-vis long-term marketing efficiency, its cost of capital, and the degree to which its stock price reflects actual future performance (i.e., stock price informativeness). The results show that marketing asset accountability improves long-term marketing efficiency, reduces cost of equity, and improves stock price informativeness, but does not consistently affect short-term marketing efficiency and cost of debt. Moreover, although marketing-intensive firms are commonly assumed to benefit most from marketing asset accountability, this is not the case. These results have implications for researchers, managers, and public policy decision makers.\n",

            "Abstract: Does parents’ status motivation affect their educational product choices for their children? Across seven studies, the authors find that when parents believe that society provides enough opportunities for individuals to achieve higher social status through hard work (i.e., high social mobility), they prioritize the status advancement goal and prefer products that help maximize a child's strengths. However, when parents believe that even if one works hard, the opportunity to climb up the social ladder is limited (i.e., low social mobility), they focus on maintaining their current status and prefer products that help remedy a child's weaknesses. Moreover, the research demonstrates that this effect diminishes when the strength and weakness are in the domains that have low relevance to status. Finally, the research shows that when parents believe that children with specialties are more likely to succeed, they prefer products for maximizing strengths, whereas when they believe that well-rounded children are more likely to succeed, they prefer products for remedying weaknesses, regardless of their perception of social mobility.\n",

            "Abstract: Following trends in entertainment streaming services, online educational platforms are increasingly offering users flexible “on-demand” content options. It is important to understand how the timing of content release affects learning behaviors and firm revenue drivers. The current research studies over 67,000 users taking a marketing course before versus after a natural experiment in which the platform switched the course from a scheduled weekly-release format to an on-demand format with all content immediately available. The switch to on-demand positively impacted short-term firm revenue by increasing the number and proportion of certificate-paying users, suggesting that on-demand content can attract a broader set of consumers who value flexibility. On the downside, the switch resulted in users exhibiting lower lecture completion rates and quiz performance and taking fewer additional business courses on the platform, representing a long-term cost. The results were robust to propensity score matching and stratification. The analyses also revealed that on-demand content enabled learning patterns that deviated from a standard evenly paced schedule, including “strategic” binge learning and stretching out engagement past the recommended course period. Thus, while on-demand formats can boost revenues by bringing in more paying users, managers must consider new strategies for maintaining performance and engagement levels within these environments.\n",

            "Abstract: Research examining the antecedents of recalls, instead of their consequences, is relatively sparse and has not considered whether firms’ likelihood to recall products is influenced by legal changes that could induce managerial opportunism, such as those reducing shareholder litigation risk. To examine this question, the authors exploit the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws across several U.S. states as a quasi-natural experiment. UD laws aim to prevent frivolous litigation from disrupting a firm's normal business operations by making it more difficult for shareholders to sue managers for neglecting their fiduciary duties and hold them personally liable. Although UD laws are well-intended, the reduced threat of shareholder litigation disciplining a firm's managers could have unintended negative consequences. Indeed, using a difference-in-differences analysis, the authors find that following the adoption of UD laws, affected firms become less likely to recall products. This effect is weaker in the presence of organizational mechanisms constraining managers’ self-interest-seeking behavior, such as a corporate culture focused on customer needs and interests or the exercise of normative control through monitoring by institutional investors. The authors do not find support for a potential alternative explanation of operational improvement and therefore higher product quality driving their findings.\n",

            "Abstract: On user-generated content platforms, individuals and firms alike seek to build and expand their follower base to eventually increase the reach of the content they upload. The bulk of the seeding literature in marketing suggests targeting users with a large follower base, that is, high-status influencers. In contrast, some recent studies find targeting lower-status influencers to be a more effective seeding policy. This multimethod article shifts the focus from the follower base of the seeding target to the focal content creator. The authors propose accelerating natural triadic closure by leveraging first-degree followers as interconnectors to target second-degree followers, that is, the nearby (low-status) influencers (who are interconnected with the focal content creator). Empirical studies document that this seeding target is much more effective for building and expanding the follower base, compared with targeting influencers who are not interconnected with the focal content creator—that is, the remote (both high- and low-status) influencers—by 2,300% and 46%, respectively. These studies on the acceleration of natural triadic closure are augmented by a preregistered field experiment to obtain convergent validity of the findings.\n",

            "Abstract: Online retailers worldwide invest beyond their core business of retailing to offer their own delivery services (ODS) to deliver products to customers’ homes through their own logistics network. How does this shift to ODS affect customers’ behaviors and sales performance? When and why do retailers venture beyond their core competence to offer ODS? To explore these questions, the authors analyze 250,055 customer transactions over 10 years across 416 cities and 49 product categories from JD, a major online retailer in China. Using difference-in-differences models, causal mediation analysis, and the synthetic control method, they find that ODS increases customers’ monthly spending by 7.8% and grows city-level sales by 11.9%. This study is the first to quantify the sales impact of ODS and shed light on when and why it works. The findings reveal that ODS has greater value for markets with lower trust levels, infrequent customers, high-risk product categories, and consumers who prefer the focal retailer (versus that of third-party sellers). Causal mediation analysis further reveals that ODS not only improves delivery quality but also builds customer trust, which together increase customers’ monthly spending, purchase frequency, and the number of items ordered.\n",

            "Abstract: When a firm collaborates with its suppliers, it expands its access to external know-how and thus can enhance its innovation performance. Such collaborations are common and argued to have significant impact on the firm's market outcomes. However, such collaborations also expose the firm to various transactional hazards, including knowledge spillovers and opportunism. This trade-off looms over the firm's commitment to a market positioning strategy and the functional capabilities it draws on to generate its strategy dividend. Recent accounts suggest that the verdict on supplier collaborations is noisy and that partner perceptions of these collaborations do not align on key issues of governance, strategy, and value generation. To investigate this, the authors study 202 formal codevelopment contracts of high-tech original equipment manufacturers that collaborated with suppliers from 1985 to 2016. Drawing on the governance value analysis framework, the authors show how misalignment between the firm's codevelopment contracts, capabilities, and market positioning strategy significantly erodes its innovation performance. Thus, blanket prescriptions for one type of contract or the other are misdirected, their effectiveness being a contingent outcome dependent on the firm's market positioning strategy and functional capabilities. This research presents one of the most complete tests of the governance value analysis framework to date.\n",

Such collaborations are common and argued to have significant impact on the firm's market outcomes. However, such collaborations also expose the firm to various transactional hazards, including knowledge spillovers and opportunism. This trade-off looms over the firm's commitment to a market positioning strategy and the functional capabilities it draws on to generate its strategy dividend. Recent accounts suggest that the verdict on supplier collaborations is noisy and that partner perceptions of these collaborations do not align on key issues of governance, strategy, and value generation. To investigate this, the authors study 202 formal codevelopment contracts of high-tech original equipment manufacturers that collaborated with suppliers from 1985 to 2016. Drawing on the governance value analysis framework, the authors show how misalignment between the firm's codevelopment contracts, capabilities, and market positioning strategy significantly erodes its innovation performance. Thus, blanket prescriptions for one type of contract or the other are misdirected, their effectiveness being a contingent outcome dependent on the firm's market positioning strategy and functional capabilities. This research presents one of the most complete tests of the governance value analysis framework to date.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
